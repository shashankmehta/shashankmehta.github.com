_Update (17th Dec 2013): I have moved from Octopress framework to plain Jekyll. I'll still be taking care of issues in Greyshade. You can check out demo of theme from any site in this [list](https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade/wiki/Sites-using-Greyshade)_

This started off as a redesign of Watch Out! News Agency's [blog](http://wona.github.com) (WONA is the official news magazine of IIT Roorkee). I had a design in mind for my personal blog which is also based on octopress. So I went ahead and implemented it on WONA's blog. Everything was fine except that I had customised my blog which meant that it was different from the WONA blog. This wouldn't have been a problem if I had followed octopress' guidelines on creating themes. Ah well. So I sat down one fine morning and converted the custom css/html to a theme. 

I used the theme [Slash](https://github.com/tommy351/Octopress-Theme-Slash) as my starting point. It already had fancybox integration and one column layout. The product is Greyshade. It's a responsive theme. I have open sourced it and it is available on [github](http://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade).

<div class="github-widget" data-repo="shashankmehta/greyshade"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/jquery.githubRepoWidget.js"></script>
