I spend a lot of my awake time on the Internet. So naturally, there are a few services that I love and, to be honest, depend upon. For example, I can't live without GMail, Youtube, Workflowy among a lot of others. But nowadays I always have this fear that a service that I like and depend upon might just shutdown. This actually happened to me recently when Clipboard was bought by Salesforce and Google decided to close Reader. If I go back a bit in time, I was once planning on hosting this blog on Posterous. Posterous ain't no more either.  

Yes I've heard all the "if you are not paying for it..." arguments that are out there and I somewhat agree with them. But does being a paid service guarantee that it will never drop me and my data in a bin on some fine day and move on?
