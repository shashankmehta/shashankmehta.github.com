  <p>Every guy needs a To Do list for his daily life to make some sense. Atleast I believe that every guy needs a To Do list especially if he has a <em>lot</em> to do. If you are one of those seemingly mythical creature who manages to stay on top of their work without this <em>list</em> well then, hats off to you <em>sir</em>. I for one do need such a list in order to keep track of what I have to do in near future and what I would like to do in some distant future. I tried out numerous applications and none seemed to fit the bill. My main requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offline Access</li>
<li>Online Access</li>
<li>Easy backup</li>
<li>I should be able to carry it in a usb drive if I want to</li>
<li>Easy input method</li>
</ul>
<!-- more -->
<p>Many apps failed to tick all the checkboxes. Some managed to do so but they literally had to crawl on their fours for that. In other words, I did not like any app that I tried.
If you have read my previous blog post <a href="http://shashankmehta.in/archive/2012/github-octopress-and-blogging.html">[Github, Octopress and Blogging]</a> then you'd know that my workflow already involves Sublime Text, Dropbox, Git among other stuff. And you might have also realised that I like to stick to this workflow for things that I normally associate the word &quot;procrastination&quot; with. This time, there was no GitHub Page or Octopress type solution like I had last time. <a href="http://todotxt.com" title="ToDo.txt">ToDo.txt</a> by Gina Trapani does come a bit close to what I want but nay, I prefer my current setup.</p>
<p>My current setup, as you might have guessed, involves</p>
<ol>
<li>Sublime Text: For the creation and editing of my simple self created format for Todo list</li>
<li>Dropbox: For syncing and an online copy</li>
<li>Git: For interesting stuff</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to Dropbox, the file is available to me everywhere.
I save my ToDo file as .css so that I get simple highlighting for my sections which I name as #SectionName.
Example ToDo list:
This is how it looks in Sublime Text:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/todoeg.png" alt="ToDo example"></p>
<p>#Today and #Tomorrow section are for planning out my tasks. I add all tasks with a deadline in #Time_Constraint. Apart from these three sections, rest keep changing as and how I need them to be. I nest tasks in order to break down bigger tasks into smaller, one-at-a-time doable tasks.
If most of your tasks have a time constraint then this might not work for you. You don't need a list, you need a calendar then my friend.</p>
<p>My ToDo list currently has ~180 lines with, on an average, less than 5 tasks in #Time_Constraint. So this setup works perfectly for me.</p>
<p>Now comes the interesting part. I use git to track changes over the period. I can easily go back in time to see which task was removed when. Its not very user friendly but with &quot;tig&quot; its manageable. Also, I make commits as and when I see fit with the commit messages being mostly like a short diary entry. I'd love to make a gui app which basically has a slider at the bottom and I can move it to see the state of my todo list at a particular point in time. Hmmm, I should file that in tasks for future.</p>
